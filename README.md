# **Numerical Analysis of the Photoelectric Effect**

This project demonstrates the application of numerical methods to analyze the **photoelectric effect**, a fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics. The analysis involves deriving **Planck's constant ($h$)** and the **work function ($W$)** of a material using simulated experimental data.

---

## **Overview**

The photoelectric effect describes the emission of electrons from a metal surface when exposed to light of a certain frequency. The relationship between the kinetic energy ($K$) of ejected electrons and the frequency ($f$) of incident light is given by:

$$
K = h f - W
$$

Where:
- $K$: Kinetic energy of ejected electrons.
- $h$: Planck's constant.
- $f$: Frequency of incident light.
- $W$: Work function of the metal (minimum energy required to eject an electron).

This repository demonstrates how four numerical methods are applied to this phenomenon:

1. **Root Finding**: Calculate the threshold frequency ($f_{\text{threshold}}$).
2. **Curve Fitting**: Determine $h$ and $W$ from experimental data.
3. **Differentiation and Integration**: Analyze the rate of change and cumulative effects.
4. **Optimization**: Minimize errors in the theoretical model to refine parameters.

## **Steps in the Experiment**

### 1. **Data Generation**
Simulated experimental data is generated using:
- A linear relationship between frequency ($f$) and kinetic energy ($K$).
- Added random noise to emulate real experimental conditions.

### 2. **Numerical Methods Applied**
#### a) **Root Finding**
- Calculate the threshold frequency ($f_{\text{threshold}} = W / h$).

#### b) **Curve Fitting**
- Use least squares optimization to fit the experimental data to the theoretical model.

#### c) **Differentiation and Integration**
- Numerical differentiation: Validate the relationship $\frac{dK}{df} = h$.
- Numerical integration: Calculate the total energy or number of electrons emitted.

#### d) **Optimization**
- Use optimization algorithms to minimize the error between the model and experimental data.

### 3. **Visualization**
- Plot the experimental data, theoretical model, and fitted curve for comparison.
